# Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

The VCD Simple Blog application implements Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles to model complex business domains and ensure that the code structure reflects the business reality.

## Overview

Domain-Driven Design is an approach to software development that focuses on understanding the business domain and creating a software model that reflects it. It emphasizes collaboration between technical and domain experts to create a shared understanding of the domain.

## Key DDD Concepts in Our Application

### 1. Bounded Contexts

Bounded contexts are explicit boundaries within which a domain model applies. They help manage complexity by dividing a large domain into smaller, more manageable parts.

Our application has the following bounded contexts:

- **Blog Context**: Everything related to blog posts, including creation, publishing, and tagging
- **User Context**: User management, profiles, and preferences
- **Authentication Context**: User authentication, authorization, and session management

Each bounded context has its own domain model, repository, and service implementations.

### 2. Entities

Entities are objects with a distinct identity that runs through time and different states. They are mutable and have a lifecycle.

Examples:
```go
// Blog Entity
type Blog struct {
    ID          string
    Title       string
    Content     string
    AuthorID    string
    Status      valueobject.BlogStatus
    Tags        []string
    PublishedAt *time.Time
    CreatedAt   time.Time
    UpdatedAt   time.Time
}

// User Entity
type User struct {
    ID        string
    Email     string
    Username  string
    Password  string
    Role      valueobject.UserRole
    CreatedAt time.Time
    UpdatedAt time.Time
}
```

### 3. Value Objects

Value objects are immutable objects that describe characteristics of a domain. They have no identity and are defined by their attributes.

Examples:
```go
// BlogStatus Value Object
type BlogStatus string

const (
    Draft     BlogStatus = "draft"
    Published BlogStatus = "published"
    Archived  BlogStatus = "archived"
)

// UserRole Value Object
type UserRole string

const (
    Admin    UserRole = "admin"
    Author   UserRole = "author"
    Commenter UserRole = "commenter"
)
```

### 4. Aggregates

Aggregates are clusters of domain objects (entities and value objects) that are treated as a single unit. They have a root entity that serves as the entry point.

In our application:
- **Blog Aggregate**: Blog is the root entity, with Comments as child entities
- **User Aggregate**: User is the root entity, with Profile as a child entity

### 5. Domain Services

Domain services encapsulate domain logic that doesn't naturally fit within an entity or value object.

Example:
```go
// BlogPublishingService
type BlogPublishingService struct {
    blogRepo repository.BlogRepository
    userRepo repository.UserRepository
}

func (s *BlogPublishingService) PublishBlog(ctx context.Context, blogID string, userID string) error {
    // Check if user has permission to publish
    // Update blog status
    // Trigger publication events
}
```

### 6. Repositories

Repositories provide a way to obtain and persist aggregates. They abstract the underlying data storage mechanism.

Example:
```go
// BlogRepository Interface
type BlogRepository interface {
    FindAll(ctx context.Context, limit, offset int) ([]*entity.Blog, error)
    FindByID(ctx context.Context, id string) (*entity.Blog, error)
    FindByAuthorID(ctx context.Context, authorID string, limit, offset int) ([]*entity.Blog, error)
    Create(ctx context.Context, blog *entity.Blog) error
    Update(ctx context.Context, blog *entity.Blog) error
    Delete(ctx context.Context, id string) error
}
```

### 7. Ubiquitous Language

A shared language between developers and domain experts that is used consistently in code, documentation, and conversation.

Our ubiquitous language includes terms like:
- Blog, Post, Article
- Author, User, Reader
- Publish, Draft, Archive
- Comment, Reply
- Tag, Category

## Benefits of DDD in Our Application

1. **Alignment with Business**: The code structure reflects the business domain, making it easier to understand and maintain.
2. **Reduced Complexity**: Bounded contexts help manage complexity by dividing the domain into smaller parts.
3. **Better Communication**: Ubiquitous language improves communication between technical and domain experts.
4. **Flexibility**: The domain model can evolve as the business requirements change.
5. **Testability**: Domain logic is isolated and can be tested independently of infrastructure concerns.
